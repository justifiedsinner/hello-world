# hello-world
Learning code for an absolute beginne.
Hi
My name is Kenny and I'm learning to code.
I read a book "Cross Over To HTML5 Game Develepment" and then decided I would like to learn more about coding.
I'm currently working my way through W3 Schools site and trying to learn JavaScript.
I am simply retyping all the stages in to my text editor (Brackets) on a late 2010 Macbook Pro.
