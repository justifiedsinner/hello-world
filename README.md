Learning code for absolute beginner
Hi
My name Kenny
I'm learning to code.
I read a book "Cross Over To HTML5 Game Develepment"
And then decided I woulk like to learn more about coding.
I'm currently working through W3 Schools site and learn JavaScript.
I am simply retyping all the stages in to a text editor (Brackets)
