Learning code for an absolute beginner.
Hi
My name is Kenny and I'm at the first steps of learning to code.
I read a book "Cross Over To HTML5 Game Develepment" and then decided I would like to learn more about coding.
I'm currently working my way through W3 Schools site and trying to learn JavaScript.
I am simply retyping all the stages in to my text editor (Brackets) on a late 2010 Macbook Pro. My thought is as 
I know very little/absolutely nothing about coding, doing it this way I am at least committing myself to it and perhaps will develop muscle memory.
